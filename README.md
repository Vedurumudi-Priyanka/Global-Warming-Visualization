# Global-Warming-Visualization
Global warming Visualized through Temperature,Energy Consumption &amp; Carbon Emissions of World During 1965-2013

In this project, attempted to raise people's awareness on the issue of global warming by visualizing the world's temperature along with the amount of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions that each country has used or produced each year from 1965 to 2012. provided 3 visualizations, which are linked on top of this page:


![Global-Emissions (for readme choice)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62755670/121862331-57bf5c00-cd18-11eb-9f43-16610f0d269b.jpg)


1) A world map, the one that you are currently seeing, gives you an overview of how the world is changing year by year. For example, a big part of Europe became much warmer in 1995 compared to 1965. You can select an indicator and a year at the bottom of this page to see the changes. Hovering your mouse over a country on the map will give you more specific information about that country.

2) You can find detailed data of each country in our second visualization. After typing a country name in the search box and click the search button, three pie charts will be displayed. Each chart provides a 50-year view on one aspect of the selected country -- Temperature, Energy Consumption, or Carbon Emission. In one chart, each arc represents a year, and each layer represents a decade. By layering the decades, we can immediately see the change of a country 10 years after. For example, China has been successfully brought its average temperature down during 2001 - 2011. However, they are doing poorly in controlling their energy consumption and carbon emission. These two indicators are reaching their peaks in the few recent years.

3) Our last visualization is an interactive board which shows the top ten countries that consumed the most energy or emitted the most carbon dioxide each year. When chosen an indicator and select a year, the top 10 will be updated. Accordingly, sky color and sea level will change to give a sense of global warming. 

With this visualization, I attempt to suggest some potential factors that may invoke audience's further thoughts: could global warming possibly affect sea level and air quality? Which countries are using too much energy or producing too much pollution? If they could control such factors, would the world's average temperature go down?

Hopefully our work will be able to help people see the danger of global warming and the threats caused by energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The responsibility belongs to every one of us.

Climate change is real.
